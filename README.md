# A-New-Design-For-Memristive-Neural-Network-Crossbar-Array
 This repository includes the coding files and reporting pictures of my undergraduate project - Summer 2022
Winner of the Best Undergraduate Project Award

## Some Instructions
 The memristor and transistor models was adopted from the arizona state university model. But I made some changes in the VerilogA code to keep the memristors resistance constant while doing refering computation with the implemented neural network crossbars.<br />
 .tr file were deleted from the local repository because they were 250+ MB. You can compile the provided files yourself and obtain .tr files. If not, you can view the pictures of the Report folder.<br />
 C stands for crossbar and T stands for transistor.
